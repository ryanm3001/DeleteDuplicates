RUN INSTRUCTIONS
At this time, ant builds the program, but it does not receive arguments.
You will find Tsunami directory and test.txt in the bin directory for testing
the application with a Directory or File as an argument.

Ant stores .class files in temp build folder, but I also included previously compiled .class
files in the src directory along with test files for easy testing.
